# Open Anaconda Prompt here

## Steps:

### First find the folder where cwp.py is available.
#### Using anaconda in windows

*Open Anaconda Prompt and type: **where cwp.py**
*you will obtain a path, copy the file directory without the file that's mean without **\cwp.py**, for me it was **C:\Users\HomePath\Anaconda3**

### Second Step
* Download the **cwp-modified.py**
* Copy the **cwp-modified.py** in the same directory.

### 3rd Step
* Edit the add-anaconda.reg on Notepad, to enter proper directory. In my case, the directory was C:\Users\HomePath\Anaconda3 , If your directory is different, replace 'C:\\Users\\HomePath\\Anaconda3' part with yours. (It can be found under C:\Users\HomePath\Anaconda3)

### Last Step
* Double-click the add-anaconda.reg file to merge it with your system.
