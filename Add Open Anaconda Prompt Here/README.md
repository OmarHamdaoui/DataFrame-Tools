Copy the path without taking the file name that's mean without **\cwp.py**.
so your path shoud look just like that : **C:\Users\OmarHAMDAOUI\Anaconda3**

### Second Step
* Download the **cwp-modified.py**
* Navigate to the path you've found before
* Copy the **cwp-modified.py** to this path.

### 3rd Step
* Edit the add-anaconda.reg on Notepad or another editor, replace the path with the perevious path that you've found before. In my case, the directory was **C:\Users\HomePath\Anaconda3**, add Backslash to this path here is an example.
* From **C:\Users\OmarHAMDAOUI\Anaconda3** to **C:\\Users\\OmarHAMDAOUI\\Anaconda3**.
* Save the file.
