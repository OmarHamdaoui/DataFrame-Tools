Copy the path without taking the file name that's mean without **\cwp.py**.
so your path shoud look just like that : **C:\Users\HomePath\Anaconda3**

### Second Step
* Download the **cwp-modified.py**
* Copy the **cwp-modified.py** to the same directory.

### 3rd Step
* Edit the add-anaconda.reg on Notepad or another editer, and replace the path with the perevious path that you've got before. In my case, the directory was **C:\Users\HomePath\Anaconda3**.

### Last Step
* Double-click the add-anaconda.reg file to merge it with your system.
